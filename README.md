Made for HackClub's Blueprint.

# Why did I make this project?

* I wanted a backup in case my other Prototype project was classified as Tier 5 (no longer applies).
* I needed a holiday gift!
* I wanted to earn some tickets!
* I already had a MagSafe charger lying around and wanted an excuse to order another!
